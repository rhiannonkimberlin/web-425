Children of Hematoi and mortals—well, not so much. Half-bloods only have two options: become trained Sentinels who hunt and kill daimons or become servants in the homes of the pures. Seventeen-year-old Alexandria would rather risk her life fighting than waste it scrubbing toilets. Alex must stay alive long enough to graduate from the Convenant and become a Sentinel. If she fails in her suty, she faces a future worse than death or slavery: being turned into a daimon and being hunted.',

When the gods are involved, some decisions can never, ever be undone.',
